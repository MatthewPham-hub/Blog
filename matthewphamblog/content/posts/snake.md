Implementation of snake in C made for the Atari ST, source code can unfortunately not be shared. [Link to the compiled snake project!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fAjvW5q3LlRVrmhHoUZj5cTk5omcSDfJ/view?usp=sharing)

One of the most informative projects I have worked on, coded in a mix of Motorola 68000 assembly and C. Coding my own interrupts and double buffering, and other features on a very old computer was very enlightening.
